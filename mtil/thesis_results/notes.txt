- clip vs finetuning has opposite effects on datasets
    - Where clip is originally accurate at, finetuning causes a decrease in accuracy (does not happen for ZSCL methods)

- orthogonal and freezing layers have higher accuracies but not much especially with OGD

- orthogonal is worse at top5 accuracies
    - worse at zeroshot tasks?
    - tends to focus on previous gradients too much?

- finetuning as expected has worse performance on average
    - with some exceptions

    - Mostly those that it has not trained on
